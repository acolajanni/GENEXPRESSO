GENEXPRESSO is an R package for R 3.6 allowing you to compare different methods of normalization in combination with various statistical analysis to discover differentially expressed genes in a microarray (affymetrix hgu 133 plus 2.0), RNAseq, and one example of Nanostring nCounter dataset. 
Few methods based on correlation are also implemented to analyse coexpression networks.

Installation : 

library("devtools")
install_github("acolajanni/GENEXPRESSO")

If it doesn't work, follow the instruction in script "./GENEXPRESSO/setup/setup.R". The missing packages should be installed afterwards.
