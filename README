GENEXPRESSO is an R package allowing you to compare different methods of normalization in combination with various statistical analysis to discover differentially expressed genes in a microarray (affymetrix hgu 133 plus 2.0), RNAseq, and one example of Nanostring nCounter dataset. 
Few methods based on correlation are also implemented to analyse coexpression networks.
