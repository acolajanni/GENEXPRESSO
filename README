GENEXPRESSO is an R package allowing you to compare different methods of normalization in combination with various statistical analysis to discover differentially expressed genes in a microarray (affymetrix hgu 133 plus 2.0), RNAseq, and one example of Nanostring nCounter dataset. 
Few methods based on correlation are also implemented to analyse coexpression networks.

Installation : 

library("devtools")
install_github("acolajanni/GENEXPRESSO")

If it doesn't work, make sure the project is launch with GENEXPRESSO.Rproj, and this line is printed :

'/path/to/file/GENEXPRESSO' loaded. [renv 0.13.2]

If not you may need to install "Renv" :
install.packages("renv")


Then, make : 

renv::hydrate()

Everything should work.
